  <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

  <p><span style="font-size:16px">Hello! My name is <strong>PRABHJOT SINGH</strong> but I go by <strong>PRABH</strong>. You might be wondering, how do I say that? Well it&#39;s easy! Just cut problem in half. Prob! Anyway now for the more important stuff. I am currently a <strong>THIRD YEAR</strong> studying <strong>COMPUTER SCIENCE</strong> at the <strong>UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI (UC)</strong>. I live in&nbsp;<strong>WEST CHESTER TOWNSHIP, OHIO&nbsp;</strong>with my amazing aunt and uncle. Currently, for my current co-op I work at&nbsp;<strong>LONDON COMPUTER SYSTEMS (LCS) </strong>as a developer where I just recently gained hands on experience with real world code and it is still blowing my mind.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size:16px">Along with working at LCS, I also work at&nbsp;<strong>OKEANA FOOD MART&nbsp;</strong>as a <strong>CASHIER</strong>, this is a job I have held since the beginning of high school and have truley come to enjoy. While working at the register, I have had the opprotunity to handle inventory, price databases, and backend paperwork.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size:16px">During my semester at UC I work as&nbsp;<strong>TEACHING ASISTANT (TA)</strong>. Working with many incoming freshman has not only deepened my understaing of core engineering ideas but also allowed me to asist students. I really enjoy the TA led sessions and simply helping students when they require it (most rewarding feeling ever). Oh and I guess all the grading can be fun too...</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size:16px">When I am not in class or working I enjoy running, biking, driving (with a good playlist), and hanging with friends (pictured below). My favorite food is pasta and I drink milk as a refreshment sometimes (which is perfectly normal).</span></p>
