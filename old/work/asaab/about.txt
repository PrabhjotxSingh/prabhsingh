<p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">For this website, I was approached by the technology chair of SAAB, a student lead leadership organization, to create a website for their members. The website proved to be very useful for everyone as they could download all the required content for the week and quickly access files. It also allowed students to view a basic information about the tons of speakers that visited and view important alerts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">Creating this website was proved to be very difficult at first. Firstly, there was an issue with the amount of content I received. I was a given word file with about each speaker along with a profile image. I was also given files that the members needed easy access to. However, I was not given many standard photos for the other various pages. I also had to make the website easy to update for non-programmers since the speaker list needs to be constantly changing. Lastly, the website had to work well on all screen sizes. For the speakers, I decided to create a standard folder structure for each one. Each speaker had a folder with the name of their first name initial and last name. The folder contained a text file for the name and one for the video link. It also contained the Word file content and profile image. A PHP file would then pull all this data and display it as an option on the speaker menu. It would also combine the various files to generate a page displaying key information that the menu would link to. This made it super easy to update as well since the administrators just had to upload a folder with the various files in a certain directory. A similar method was used on the members page, administrators would just upload the various content students needed for the week and a PHP file would automatically generate download links for each file. The website was then made fully responsive which involved rewriting the style for almost every element as I wanted this website to work on any screen size.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>FINAL THOUGHTS</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">This website was fun to make! It was the first time I made a website that was publicly used to such an extent. It felt good seeing the admins make changes to it and seeing the students use it daily.</span></p>
