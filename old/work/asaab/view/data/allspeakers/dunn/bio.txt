When not pitching, he patrolled center field and was known as a clutch hitter at the plate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andy went on to play at Mount Vernon Nazarene University where he helped guide his team to a National Championship in 2002. &nbsp;He still holds numerous records there including consecutive free throws made (36) and most 3-point field goals in a season (150).</p>
