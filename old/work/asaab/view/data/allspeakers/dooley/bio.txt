    A dominant front-line player, she became the first in Lakota district
    history to be credited with over 1000 career kills. Ten years later she is
    still just one of only two to reach the 1000 mark. Her senior kill total of
    406 still stands as the Lakota district single season record. She also
    holds all Lakota West records, career, and season, for blocks.
