    The hard work will pay off. The long hours in the gym, being too busy for

    THE BEST THING ABOUT BEING A FIREBIRD WAS:
</p>
<p>
    being in the first official class of Lakota West. Since I was in high
    school from 1997-2000, I was part of the school opening ceremony, starting
    new Firebird traditions and the beginning of a new legacy.

    Sports gave me great travel opportunities. I was able to spend a summer
    playing basketball in Fiji, New Zealand and Jamaica. Also, I am married to
