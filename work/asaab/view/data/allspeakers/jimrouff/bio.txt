    During Jim's 19 seasons as a head baseball coach at Lakota he amassed 268
    wins, still the most of any coach in the 51-year history of Lakota district
    baseball. With Lakota being the second school at which Rouff served as head
    coach, his total head coaching career win record is well past the 300 mark,
    making him one of but a handful of coaches in Southwest Ohio to attain this
    level. He is a member of the Lakota Hall of Fame.

    director, Jim hired one of his former Lakota players, Ray Hamilton, to
