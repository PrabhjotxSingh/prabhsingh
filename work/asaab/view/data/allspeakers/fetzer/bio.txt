    Coach Fetzer was the first wrestling head coach at Lakota West and led that
    program through 13 highly successful seasons. Prior to that he had served
    as an assistant coach for six seasons at Lakota.

<div>
    In dual meet competition his teams achieved 149 wins, more than has been
    achieved during the tenure of any of the 13 head coaches that have coached
    wrestling in the Lakota High Schools. Two of his teams were voted
    Cincinnati Metro champions by the Cincinnati Enquirer Coach's Poll.

    When it became tournament time in early February, he carried on the old
    Lakota tradition of designating it as the month of champions. In his years
    as head coach he watched his athletes mount the top step of the victory
    stand as champions 110 times at the GMC, sectional, district and state
    series of meets held during this month. That number has also not been
    matched or exceeded during the tenure of any past or present Lakota
    district wrestling coach.

<div>
    He is one of the few coaches to have coached a senior National Champion and
    has taken four athletes to the National tournament with all four attaining
    top five finishes.
</div>
<div>
    He rolled these individual successes into team successes, which yielded
    Lakota West team championships in seven GMC meets, seven sectional meets,
    and a district meet.
</div>
<div>
    His 2006 and 2007 teams both finished fifth at the State Final meets. These
    two finishes were out of an initial field of 173 D-1 schools and are tied
    as the highest finishes by any Lakota district wrestling teams.
