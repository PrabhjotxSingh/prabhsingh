    FAVORITE POEM:
    <br/>
    <em>The Angel of the Night</em>
    - Lt. Col. Dave Grossman
</p>
<p>
    Fear not the night.
</p>
<p>
    Fear that which walks the night.
</p>
<p>
    And *I* am that which walks the night
</p>
<p>
    But only evil need fear me&#8230;
</p>
<p>
    And gentle souls sleep safe in their beds&#8230;
</p>
<p>
    Because I walk the night.
