    QUOTE THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU:
</p>
<p>
    'Difficult is our Decision.' Each year at Illinois we would have a team
    motto for the season. This was one of my favorites that I connected with.

    IF YOU KNEW THEN WHAT YOU KNOW NOW&#8230;WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THE HIGH
    SCHOOL KARA?:
</p>
<p>
    I would tell myself to 'Enjoy it more. Every second.' You always hear
    people older than you tell you it goes by way too fast, and they're all
    right! I would also tell myself to be more confident (not cocky, but
    confident in myself) especially as a freshman/ sophomore playing (at any
    level). You have nothing to lose and you can surprise a lot of people if
    you go in with some more confidence.

    THE BEST THING ABOUT BEING A FIREBIRD WAS&#8230;
</p>
<p>
    Being able to play multiple sports and create everlasting memories, having
    different coaches, mentors and teachers that were very influential in
    shaping who I am today.

    CURRENT JOB: I'm a speech language pathologist. I work in an acute
    rehabilitation unit at Mercy Fairfield Hospital with adults. I mostly work
    with patients who have sustained neurological impairments such as a stroke
    or traumatic brain injury that affect their speech, cognition and/ or
    swallowing.

    ANYTHING ELSE FUN THAT WE SHOULD KNOW?: I've been married for one year, I'm
    pregnant with my first child and am due in May!
