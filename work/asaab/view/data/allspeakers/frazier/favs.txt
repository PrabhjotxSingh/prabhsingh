    BOOK FOR LEADERS: I tend to only read fiction books, but my best friend
Maureen, who was a sports leadership and management major, recommends    <em>Energy Bus, Leaders Eat First, and Win at Losing</em>.

    ATHLETE: swimmers of course-- Natalie Coughlin, Elizabeth Biesel, and
    Rebecca Soni (all retired now). I still follow the swimming world closely
    and root on all of team USA.

    PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TEAM: I do not have a favorite professional sports team
    (family roots for the Philadelphia and Cleveland teams), but my favorite
    college team to cheer for is Penn State (my dad went to school there).

    SPORTS MOVIE: <em>Remember the Titans</em>
</p>
<p>
    PODCAST: <em>How I Built This</em> with Guy Raz. It is really interesting
    to learn about how successful companies were built, and the struggles they
    encountered along the way.

    QUOTE THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU:
</p>
<p>
    My grandma used to always say, "Only you can make you happy", which is a
    really important thing to remember. You are in control of both your
    attitude and your future.

    IF YOU KNEW THEN WHAT YOU KNOW NOW&#8230;WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THE HIGH
    SCHOOL CASEY?:
</p>
<p>
    I would tell my high school self to relax. I tend to be a bit high strung
    and high stress. I have definitely developed perspective on what's
    important and how to handle all my stresses since.

    THE BEST THING ABOUT BEING A FIREBIRD WAS&#8230;
</p>
<p>
    having teachers and coaches who truly cared to see you succeed and helped
    you grow as a person. Also getting to be in class every day with your best
    friends!

    CURRENT JOB: I work in FSO Assurance for EY (one of the big four accounting
    firms). We are a client serving business, and I specifically work in
    reviewing companies financials to make sure they are accurate and free from
    misstatement that would affect a user's (investor, creditor, etc.)
    understanding of the company. FSO means I work specifically for companies
    in the financial sector, such as Insurance companies, Banks, and Wealth and
    Asset management companies (funds). It is a good combination of my majors--
    finance and accounting.
